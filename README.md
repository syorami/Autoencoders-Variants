# Autoencoders-Variants

This is a repository about Pytorch implementations of different Autoencoders variants on MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset just for studing so training hyperparameters have not been well-tuned. The following models are going to be implemented:

- [x] Fully-connected Autoencoder
- [] Convolutional Autoencoder
- [] Sparse Autoencoder (L1 regularization / KL divergence)
- [] Denoising Autoencoder
- [] Contractive Autoencoder
- [] Variational Autoencoder
- [] Sequence-to-Sequence Autoencoder
- [] Adversarial Autoencoder

Tensorflow version may be updated in the future.
